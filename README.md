AI Chess Bot

Overview
This project involves the development of an AI Chess Bot capable of playing chess against human players or other AI opponents. The bot is built using Python and leverages advanced algorithms to evaluate game positions and make strategic decisions.

Project Description
The AI Chess Bot uses a combination of chess algorithms such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and iterative deepening depth-first search to calculate the best moves. These techniques allow the bot to think several moves ahead, considering both its own potential moves and those of its opponent. The implementation aims to optimize decision-making processes and improve the bot's performance in various game scenarios.

The bot interfaces with a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that allows players to input moves in standard chess notation and view the bot's responses. The project is designed to challenge human players, providing a tool for both entertainment and skills development in the game of chess.

Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Algorithm:** Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficient move evaluation

## Learning Outcomes
- Implementation of complex algorithms in a real-world application
- Development of efficient data structures to manage game state
- Enhancement of problem-solving and strategic thinking skills through algorithm optimization

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Select whether you want to play versus Ai, against another player locally, or watch the game of engine playing against itself by setting appropriate flags in lines 52 and 53 of ChessMain.py.
3. Run ChessMain.py.

Also
-Press z to undo a move.
-Press r to reset the game.
