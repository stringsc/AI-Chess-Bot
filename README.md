AI Chess Bot

Overview
This project involves the development of an AI Chess Bot capable of playing chess against human players or other AI opponents. The bot is built using Python and leverages advanced algorithms to evaluate game positions and make strategic decisions.

Project Description
The AI Chess Bot uses a combination of chess algorithms such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and iterative deepening depth-first search to calculate the best moves. These techniques allow the bot to think several moves ahead, considering both its own potential moves and those of its opponent. The implementation aims to optimize decision-making processes and improve the bot's performance in various game scenarios.

The bot interfaces with a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that allows players to input moves in standard chess notation and view the bot's responses. The project is designed to challenge human players, providing a tool for both entertainment and skills development in the game of chess.

Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Algorithm:** Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficient move evaluation

Setup and Running
The repository includes detailed instructions for setting up the Python environment, installing dependencies, and running the chess bot to start playing. Users can interact with the bot through the CLI, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced chess players.

## Learning Outcomes
- Implementation of complex algorithms in a real-world application
- Development of efficient data structures to manage game state
- Enhancement of problem-solving and strategic thinking skills through algorithm optimization

## How to Run
Instructions are provided for users to easily run the bot from their local machines, including steps to initiate a game, make moves, and receive feedback from the AI regarding its chosen moves.
